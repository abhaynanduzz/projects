Attrition is the departure of employees from the organization for any reason (voluntary or involuntary), including resignation, termination, death or retirement.
This dataset contains employee and company data useful for supervised ML, unsupervised ML, and analytics. Attrition - whether an employee left or not - is included and can be used as the target variable.
The data is synthetic and based on the IBM Watson dataset for attrition. Employee roles and departments were changed to reflect the healthcare domain. Also, known outcomes for some employees were changed to help increase the performance of ML models.
